# Algorithms
All are implemented using C++/C programming language
1. Divide and Conquer
  1.1 Merge Sort 
  1.2 Quick Sort 
  1.3 Number of inversions in an array 
      Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then inversion       count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum. Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j]         form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j
